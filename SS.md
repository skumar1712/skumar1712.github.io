# Introduction 
When I think of self-similarity, the first thing that comes to my mind is Romanesco broccoli. The shape is indeed self-similar and mathematically closely related to a spiral. In simple words, self-similar means that no matter how much you zoom in, you will see the same shape. This thinking can then be applied not only to shapes (sets, functions), but also to equations. 

# Self-similarity of shapes/functions
Formally, a function $f(x)$ or a set $S$ is self-similar if scaling the input by a factor $\lambda$ changes the output in a predictable, proportional way
$$
f(\lambda x) = \lambda^k f(x),
$$
where $k$ is a scaling exponent. 

# Self-similarity of equations
